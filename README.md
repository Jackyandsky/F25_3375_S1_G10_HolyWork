## 🪄 Design Concept Highlights

### 🧩 1. Cross-Church Volunteer Calendar
A unified schedule that allows users to view and sign up for volunteer opportunities across affiliated churches.  
- Role-based sign-ups (Set-up, Clean-up, Music, Hospitality, Sanctuary Guild, Kids Church)  
- Geolocation discovery for nearby service opportunities  
- Push notifications and reminders

### 📖 2. Drag-and-Drop Worship Planner
A visual interface for organizers to design the weekly “Service Book.”  
- Fixed elements (e.g., confession, benediction)  
- Variable elements (e.g., readings, songs, prayers)  
- Reusable templates for shared multi-church events

### 🙏 3. Community Prayer Wall
A social-style feature for posting and responding to prayer requests.  
- Categories (Healing, Thanksgiving, Intercession, Praise, Confession)  
- Reactions (“Praying”), comments, and anonymous posting  
- Audio/image support and integration into service agendas  

### 💬 4. Youth-Focused Engagement
Designed to appeal to digital-native users through:  
- **Gamification** (badges, leaderboards, “Volunteer of the Month”)  
- **Interactive stories and polls**  
- **Social-inspired notifications and clean, modern UI**
